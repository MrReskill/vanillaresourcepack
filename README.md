# Minecraft Pocket Edition Resource Pack Template

This is the most recent version of the add-on template. Click clone or download on the right and download the zip to get started ASAP.

**NOTE:** This repo does include sounds, but if you plan
on cloning with git the repo locally with git make sure you have Git LFS installed.

(The sole purpose of Git LFS is due to the sound files taking up 20 MB.)
